hello there! how are ya? This is an example of a tweet (or xzeet) that is longer than two hundred and eight characters in length. Such a string would not be able to be a single tweet, but would have to be split up into chunks. It's pretty easy to split up strings but still takes some concentration. Why not let our computer friends (who love strings by the way!) take care of it for us? Right, sounds reasonable.
